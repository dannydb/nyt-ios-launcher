nyt-ios-launcher
================

Launch the NYT iOS app from the home screen without having to click into the newsstand

## Install

1. Go to [http://dannydb.github.io/nyt-ios-launcher](http://dannydb.github.io/nyt-ios-launcher)
1. After the app launches, switch back to Safari
1. Tap the action button and add a bookmark to the homescreen

It's still going to take you 2-3 taps to get back out of the app to the homescreen, but at least you can skip the news stand doorman on the way in.
